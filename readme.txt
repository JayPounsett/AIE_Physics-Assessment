The game simulation within the project is incomplete, pool game is only the bare minimum to show off the physics as I had a few issues and was running out of time.

Within the project, there are other simulations in PhysicsApp::startup() that showcase physics like:
- dropBallsAndCubes()
- kinematicTest()
- ropeTest(10)
- softBodyTest()
